HL7 Message Generator
Description:

The HL7 Message Generator is a Python application built using the Tkinter library that allows users to dynamically create HL7 messages. HL7 (Health Level Seven) is a set of standards for exchanging electronic health information. This tool simplifies the process of generating HL7 messages by providing a user-friendly interface for different segments such as MSH, EVN, PID, IN1, PV1, FT1, OCR, and OBR.

Features:

Segment Selection: Choose from a variety of HL7 segments, each with its own set of fields.
Dynamic Input Fields: Input fields are dynamically generated based on the selected segment.
Message Generation: Generate HL7 messages with user-defined values for each field.
Console Output: View generated HL7 messages in the console for real-time feedback.
Save to File: Save generated HL7 messages to a text file for later use.
